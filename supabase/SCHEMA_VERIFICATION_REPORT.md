# Checks Happy — Supabase Schema Verification Report

**Generated:** 2026-03-19
**Method:** Static analysis of all 14 migration files + full codebase audit
**Note:** No live database connection available — analysis based on migration SQL and application code

---

## How This Report Was Produced

No `.env.local` files exist in the repository, so live Supabase queries could not be run.
Instead, this report was produced by:

1. Reading all 14 migration files (`001_initial_schema.sql` through `20260318_beta_access_gate.sql`)
2. Reading the mobile app's primary sync service (`manualSync.ts`), all stores, and type definitions
3. Reading the Prep app's 12 stores (`breakdownStore.ts`), type definitions, and `ScriptBreakdown.tsx`
4. Cross-referencing every table/column referenced in code against the schema defined in migrations

The report assumes all migrations have been applied in order. If any migration was skipped, the gaps identified here may be more severe than stated.

### Per-Table Column Verification

#### `users` — Status: ⚠ Functional but narrow

**Schema columns (from migrations):**
- `id` UUID PK (refs auth.users)
- `email` TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
- `name` TEXT NOT NULL
- `tier` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'trainee' CHECK (trainee/artist/supervisor/designer)
- `stripe_customer_id` TEXT
- `created_at` TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
- `beta_access` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false (added in 20260318)
- `beta_granted_at` TIMESTAMPTZ (added in 20260318)

**Code references:** Mobile `authStore.ts` reads `name`, writes `beta_access`, `beta_granted_at`, `tier`. All present.

**Issue:** No `avatar_url`, `phone`, or profile fields that Prep might need for team management display. Not blocking — can be added later.

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct for current needs

---

#### `projects` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns (from migrations):**
- `id` UUID PK DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4()
- `name` TEXT NOT NULL
- `production_type` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'film'
- `status` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'prep' CHECK (prep/shooting/wrapped)
- `invite_code` TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
- `created_by` UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)
- `created_at` TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
- `pending_deletion_at` TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL (added in 007)
- `department` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'hmu' CHECK (hmu/costume) (added in 013)
- `has_prep_access` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false (added in 014)

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct — `has_prep_access` added in migration 014, TypeScript types updated

---

#### `project_members` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id` UUID PK
- `project_id` UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id)
- `user_id` UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)
- `role` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'floor' CHECK (designer/hod/supervisor/key/floor/daily/trainee)
- `is_owner` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
- `joined_at` TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
- UNIQUE(project_id, user_id)

**Note:** The `role` CHECK constraint uses internal roles (designer, hod, etc.), not the production roles described in the master context (Key MUA, Standby Hair, Dresser, etc.). The master context says production roles are labels with no permission effect. The current `role` column serves as a permission role. A separate `production_role` column may be needed for the label users actually see.

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct for current needs. `production_role` can be added later during tier/role system work (Step 6).

---

#### `characters` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `project_id`, `name`, `actor_name`, `initials`, `avatar_colour`, `base_look_description`, `created_at`
- `metadata` JSONB DEFAULT '{}' (added in 014)

**Prep character profile fields** (`billing`, `category`, `age`, `gender`, `hairColour`, `hairType`, `eyeColour`, `skinTone`, `build`, `distinguishingFeatures`, `notes`) are stored in the `metadata` JSONB column. This avoids adding 11 columns the mobile app doesn't use.

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct — `metadata` JSONB column added in migration 014, TypeScript types updated

---

#### `scenes` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `project_id`, `scene_number`, `int_ext`, `location`, `time_of_day`, `synopsis`
- `page_count` DECIMAL(5,2), `story_day` INTEGER, `shooting_day` INTEGER
- `filming_status`, `filming_notes`, `is_complete`, `completed_at`
- `script_content` TEXT (added in 010)
- `created_at`

**All columns referenced in manualSync.ts exist.** Prep's `ParsedSceneData` maps cleanly to these columns.

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct

---

#### `scene_characters` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:** `id`, `scene_id`, `character_id`, UNIQUE(scene_id, character_id)

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct

---

#### `looks` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `project_id`, `character_id`, `name`, `description`
- `estimated_time` INTEGER DEFAULT 30
- `makeup_details` JSONB, `hair_details` JSONB
- `created_at`

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct. Complex look data stored as JSONB, which matches the mobile app's MakeupDetails/HairDetails types.

---

#### `look_scenes` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:** `id`, `look_id`, `scene_number`, UNIQUE(look_id, scene_number)

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct

---

#### `continuity_events` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `scene_id`, `character_id`, `look_id`, `shooting_day`
- `status` TEXT CHECK (not_started/in_progress/checked)
- `hair_notes`, `makeup_notes`, `prosthetics_notes`, `wounds_blood_notes`, `general_notes`
- `application_time` INTEGER
- `continuity_flags` JSONB, `continuity_events_data` JSONB, `sfx_details` JSONB
- `checked_by`, `checked_at`, `created_at`

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct

---

#### `photos` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `continuity_event_id`, `storage_path`
- `photo_type` TEXT CHECK (reference/on_set/wrap)
- `angle` TEXT CHECK (front/left/right/back/detail/additional)
- `notes`, `taken_by`, `taken_at`

**Note:** No `created_at` column — `taken_at` serves this purpose.

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct

---

#### `schedule_data` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `project_id`, `raw_pdf_text`, `cast_list` JSONB, `days` JSONB
- `status` TEXT CHECK (pending/processing/complete/partial)
- `processing_progress` JSONB
- `storage_path` TEXT (added in 010)
- `created_at`

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct

---

#### `call_sheet_data` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `project_id`, `shoot_date` DATE, `production_day` INTEGER
- `storage_path`, `raw_text`, `parsed_data` JSONB
- `uploaded_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- UNIQUE(project_id, shoot_date)

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct

---

#### `script_uploads` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `project_id`, `version_label`, `version_number` INTEGER DEFAULT 1
- `storage_path`, `file_name`, `file_size` INTEGER
- `raw_text`, `scene_count`, `character_count`, `parsed_data` JSONB
- `is_active` BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
- `status` TEXT CHECK (uploaded/parsing/parsed/error)
- `uploaded_by`, `created_at`

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct. Both mobile app and Prep's ScriptBreakdown.tsx reference matching columns.

---

#### `lookbooks` — Status: ✓ Correct (not yet used by code)

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `project_id`, `title`, `lookbook_type`, `character_id`, `shooting_day`
- `storage_path`, `file_name`, `file_size`
- `look_count`, `page_count`, `scene_count`
- `source`, `generated_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct. Table exists but is not yet referenced by any application code.

---

#### `timesheets` — Status: ✓ Correct (not yet used by sync)

**Schema columns:**
- `id`, `project_id`, `user_id`, `week_starting` DATE
- `entries` JSONB DEFAULT '[]'
- `created_at`, `updated_at`
- UNIQUE(project_id, user_id, week_starting)

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct. Not yet used in mobile sync (`manualSync.ts` doesn't touch it), but schema is ready.

---

#### `app_config` — Status: ✓ Correct

**Schema columns:** `key` TEXT PK, `value` TEXT NOT NULL, `updated_at` TIMESTAMPTZ

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct. Used for beta code validation.

## RLS Verification

Migration `011_fix_rls_policies.sql` is a comprehensive overhaul that drops ALL existing policies and recreates them cleanly. After running all migrations through 011:

| Table | SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `users` | own + teammates | own | own | — | ✓ |
| `projects` | member | auth + own | owner | owner | ✓ |
| `project_members` | member | self-join | owner | owner + self | ✓ |
| `characters` | member | member | member | member | ✓ |
| `scenes` | member | member | member | member | ✓ |
| `scene_characters` | via scenes | via scenes | via scenes | via scenes | ✓ |
| `looks` | member | member | member | member | ✓ |
| `look_scenes` | via looks | via looks | via looks | via looks | ✓ |
| `continuity_events` | via scenes | via scenes | via scenes | via scenes | ✓ |
| `photos` | via ce→scenes | via ce→scenes | via ce→scenes | via ce→scenes | ✓ |
| `schedule_data` | member | member | member | member | ✓ |
| `timesheets` | own + owner | own + member | own + member | own | ✓ |
| `call_sheet_data` | member | member | member | member | ✓ |
| `script_uploads` | member | member | member | member | ✓ |
| `lookbooks` | member | member | member | member | ✓ |
| `app_config` | public | — | — | — | ✓ |

**All tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies.**

**Note on Prep access:** All RLS policies use `is_project_member()` which checks the `project_members` table. Prep users authenticate via the same Supabase Auth and will be in the same `project_members` table, so all existing policies work for both apps without modification.

**Verdict:** ✓ Complete RLS coverage

---

## Storage Verification

### Buckets Defined in Migrations

| Bucket | Migration | Public? | RLS Policies |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `continuity-photos` | 003 | No | Full CRUD via `can_access_project_storage()` (011) |
| `project-documents` | 006 | No | Full CRUD via `can_access_project_storage()` (011) |

### Buckets Required per Master Context

| Required Bucket | Exists? | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|-------|
| `scripts` | ✗ Not as standalone | Scripts stored in `project-documents` under `{projectId}/scripts/` path |
| `continuity-photos` | ✓ | Exists and working |
| `receipts` | ✗ Missing | Not referenced in any code yet |
| `invoices` | ✗ Missing | Not referenced in any code yet |

**Key finding:** The master context lists `scripts`, `receipts`, and `invoices` as separate buckets, but the current architecture uses a single `project-documents` bucket with folder prefixes (`scripts/`, `schedules/`, `call-sheets/`, `lookbooks/`, `exports/`). This is a valid architectural choice — the `can_access_project_storage()` function works the same way regardless of subfolder.

**Receipt and invoice storage** is not yet implemented in any code. These buckets/folders should be created when the receipt scanning and invoice generation features are connected to Supabase.

**Verdict:** ✓ Working for current needs. `receipts` and `invoices` storage can be added when those features are implemented.

## RPC Functions

| Function | Migration | Auth Check | search_path |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| `handle_new_user()` | 001 | SECURITY DEFINER (trigger) | — |
| `generate_invite_code()` | 001 | N/A (helper) | — |
| `set_invite_code()` | 001 | N/A (trigger) | — |
| `set_created_by()` | 001 | SECURITY DEFINER | — |
| `update_updated_at()` | 001 | N/A (trigger) | — |
| `is_project_member()` | 011 | SECURITY DEFINER STABLE | ✓ |
| `is_project_owner()` | 011 | SECURITY DEFINER STABLE | ✓ |
| `can_access_project_storage()` | 011 | SECURITY DEFINER STABLE | ✓ |
| `can_access_storage_photo()` | 011 | Alias for above | ✓ |
| `join_project_by_invite_code()` | 014 (latest) | SECURITY DEFINER | ✓ (fixed in 013+014) |
| `lookup_project_by_invite_code()` | 011 | SECURITY DEFINER | ✓ |
| `create_project()` | 013 | SECURITY DEFINER | ✓ |
| `sync_scene_characters()` | 011 | SECURITY DEFINER + member check | ✓ |
| `sync_look_scenes()` | 011 | SECURITY DEFINER + member check | ✓ |
| `deactivate_previous_scripts()` | 011 | SECURITY DEFINER | ✓ |

**Verdict:** ✓ All RPC functions have correct `SET search_path = public`. Migration 013 fixed inline, migration 014 re-applies the corrected version.

---

## Realtime Publication

Migration 010 adds these tables to `supabase_realtime` with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`:

- `scenes`, `characters`, `looks`, `continuity_events`, `photos`
- `schedule_data`, `call_sheet_data`, `script_uploads`
- `scene_characters`, `look_scenes`

**Not in Realtime publication:**
- `users` — correct (profile changes don't need real-time broadcast)
- `projects` — correct (project metadata rarely changes)
- `project_members` — could be useful for team changes, but not critical
- `timesheets` — should be added when timesheet sync is implemented
- `lookbooks` — should be added when lookbook generation is live
- `app_config` — correct (static config)

**Verdict:** ✓ Correct for current sync needs

---

## Critical Gaps

All critical gaps have been resolved:

### 1. ✓ RESOLVED — `has_prep_access` column on `projects` table

**Fix applied:** Migration 014 adds `has_prep_access BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false`. RPCs (`create_project`, `join_project_by_invite_code`, `lookup_project_by_invite_code`) updated to accept/return the column. TypeScript types in `mobile-pwa/src/types/supabase.ts` updated.

### 2. ✓ RESOLVED — Character metadata columns for Prep persistence

**Fix applied:** Migration 014 adds `metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'` to the `characters` table. Prep serializes profile fields (billing, age, gender, etc.) into this column. TypeScript types in `mobile-pwa/src/types/supabase.ts` updated.

---

## Non-Critical Gaps

These should be fixed eventually but do not block the immediate work:

### 1. ✓ RESOLVED — `join_project_by_invite_code` missing `SET search_path`

Migration 013 fixed inline with `SET search_path = public` and `public.` schema-qualified table refs. Migration 014 re-applies the corrected version.

### 2. `receipts` and `invoices` storage not yet created

No code references these yet, so no action needed until those features are connected to Supabase.

### 3. `production_role` not in `project_members`

The master context describes production roles (Key MUA, Standby Hair, Dresser) as user-facing labels separate from permission roles. The current `role` column serves permissions. A `production_role` TEXT column should be added during tier/role system work (Step 6).

### 4. `timesheets` not in Realtime publication

Should be added when timesheet sync between App and Prep is implemented.

### 5. `lookbooks` not in Realtime publication

Should be added when lookbook generation is live and needs real-time updates.
